# innosoft_app

A web application built with **SPLENT**.

## What is SPLENT?

**SPLENT** — **S**oftware **P**roduct **L**ine **En**gineering **T**oolkit — is a
modular ecosystem for building web applications in Python following Software
Product Line (SPL) principles. It connects a **formal variability model** (the
features that exist and how they can be combined, written in UVL) with
**executable infrastructure** (Docker, databases, migrations, deployments), so a
product is *derived* from a feature selection in an automated, validated and
reproducible way.

This product is a **thin shell**: it only declares which features it includes
(see `pyproject.toml`) and SPLENT composes, validates and runs them.

## Requirements

- Docker + Docker Compose
- Python 3.13+
- `make`

## 1. Set up the workspace

This product lives inside a **SPLENT workspace** — a folder that holds the SPLENT
tooling repositories next to this product:

```
my-workspace/
├── splent_cli/          # the `splent` command (runs in Docker)
├── splent_framework/    # the Flask app factory and base classes
├── splent_catalog/      # the SPL / UVL variability models
└── innosoft_app/  # this product
```

Clone those repositories side by side in the same parent folder.

## 2. Start the SPLENT CLI

The `splent` command runs inside a Docker container that bind-mounts the
workspace at `/workspace`. Boot it once:

```bash
cd splent_cli
make setup        # prepares .env, builds & starts the CLI container, and enters it
splent --help     # now you are inside the container — list every command
```

> You don't have to stay inside the container: from the host you can run any
> command with `docker exec splent_cli_container splent <command>`.

## 3. Run this product

From inside the CLI container:

```bash
splent product:select innosoft_app
splent product:derive --dev   # build images, run migrations and start the stack
splent db:seed -y             # optional: load demo content
splent product:port           # print the local URL
```

Open the URL that `product:port` prints and you're up.

## Everyday commands

```bash
splent product:up --dev       # start the stack
splent product:down --dev     # stop the stack
splent product:logs           # tail logs
splent product:restart        # restart
```
